# Update Sharesight Custom Investment Price

* https://portfolio.sharesight.com/api/3/overview

If you added a custom investment to sharesight that isn't listed, sharesight can't automatically give you the current price.
This hacky bit of rust will yoink the fund nav price from the vanguard website and poke it into sharesight.
